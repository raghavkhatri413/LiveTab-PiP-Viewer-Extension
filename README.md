# Live Tab PiP Viewer

## Overview

**Live Tab PiP Viewer** is a lightweight web-based application that allows users to view any tab or window in Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode. The project leverages the Google Picture-in-Picture API to enhance multitasking and improve user experience. Additionally, users can create a browser extension from the code to quickly access the PiP viewer.

## Features

- Seamlessly switch any browser tab or window to PiP mode.
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- Supports live video streams and other dynamic content.
- Lightweight and responsive design.
- Supports any Chromium-based browser.
- Browser extension for quick access.

## Use Cases

1. **Multitasking:** Keep an eye on important tabs (e.g., video tutorials, meetings, live sports) while working on other tasks.
2. **Improved Workflow:** Follow instructions or reference materials in PiP mode while coding or writing.
3. **Entertainment:** Watch videos or streams without switching between tabs frequently.
4. **Remote Work:** Use PiP for video conferencing while accessing other tabs during meetings.
